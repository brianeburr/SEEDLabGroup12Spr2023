The miniproject tested the integration of each person's subsystems. For the project, the raspberry
pi tracks an aruco marker using the OpenCV platform, and initiates communication with the Arduino
to update values. The arduino then uses those updated values to run a motor and drive a wheel to 
specific angle values. The arduino then reports the current position back to an LCD. Within this 
folder are all code files, as well as matlab simulations and data.
