# Demo 1

This directory contains code and logging files used for the first robot demonstration.
Code here pertains to the three tests included in this demonstration cycle, being translation, rotation and translation, and angle detection.

The Demo1Feedback and RotationScript directories contain prior assignments' code structures that were used in building the relevant Arduino code for Demo 1.
Demo1_Feedback_Function_Implementation and FunctionImpliment_Integrator contain further developed code that concerns the translation and rotation tasks outlined for this section.

The Pose directory contains the angle detection code in angleEstimate.py, as well as several log files and a further Camera Calibration subdirectory containing calibration documents for the PiCamera.
